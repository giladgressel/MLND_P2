I## Building a Student Intervention System

In this project I build a classification system which will predict whether or not a given student is failing school based on a number of features.  There are two files to look at:

*student_intervention.ipynb
*student_intervention.pdf

The .ipynb file should be opened with jupyter notebook.  All the cells of code are already run. Make sure to leave it that way otherwise you will have to run them yourself and some codeblocks take over 10 minutes to run!

The pdf file is a report that should be read along with the jupyter notebook.
